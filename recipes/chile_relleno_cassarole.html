    <h1>Chile Relleno Cassarole</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is a Mexican-style casserole made with ground beef and green chile peppers. It produces a much simpler version of chile rellenos, which are simply stuffed chile peppers.
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                1 pound lean ground beef
                1 onion, chopped
                2 (4 ounce) cans whole green chile peppers, drained
                1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided 
                4 eggs
                ¼ cup all-purpose flour
                1 ½ cups milk
                salt and pepper to taste
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

                In a large skillet over medium-high heat, combine ground beef and onions and sauté for 5 to 10 minutes, or until browned; drain excess fat.
                
                Arrange 1 can of chile peppers on the bottom of a 7x11-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with half cheese and top with meat mixture. Sprinkle meat mixture with remaining cheese, followed by next can of chile peppers.
                
                In a medium bowl, combine eggs, flour, and milk, whisking until smooth. Pour this into the baking dish over chile peppers. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
                
                Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool for about 5 minutes before cutting
