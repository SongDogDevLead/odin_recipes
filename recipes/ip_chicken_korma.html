    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This instant pot chicken korma is rich, creamy, and flavorful. It’s the real deal y’all. This chicken korma is much tastier than what you’ll find in restaurants, and thanks to the instant pot, you can make it at home in like half an hour – definitely under an hour! The hardest part of this recipe is gathering all of the ingredients (which really takes only like 5 minutes). After that, it’s cake. Well, korma.

        This dish is also known as Shahi Chicken korma, and it’s a royal dish… literally. It’s from Mughlai cuisine, meaning that it was developed in imperial kitchens and served to royalty during the Mughal era in India (to kings, queens, jesters like me… just kidding).
        
        Mughlai dishes are a treat because they are so decadent. They’re creamy and rich and call for dried fruit and nuts, which add awesome texture. Pre-Instant Pot, I really only made korma when we were having guests over – it was a “special occasion” dish. While it’s still an excellent dish to make for guests, it’s also easy enough to make whenever I want a delicious and comforting meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        1 red onion, quartered, divided

1 green bird's eye chile pepper, stemmed

½ cup water, divided

¼ cup raw cashews

2 cloves garlic

2 tablespoons tomato paste

1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger

5 whole cloves

3 green cardamom pods

1 black cardamom pod

1 bay leaf

1 teaspoon cumin seeds

¼ teaspoon whole black peppercorns

¼ teaspoon ground coriander

¼ inch cinnamon stick

¼ cup light vegetable oil

8 ¾ ounces cauliflower, cut into large pieces

5 ¼ ounces broccoli, cut into large pieces

2 tomatoes, cut into large chunks

1 cup canned chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained with liquid reserved

1 carrot, sliced

1 red bird's eye chile pepper, chopped

½ tablespoon garam masala

½ teaspoon ground turmeric

¼ teaspoon chili powder

1 cup baby spinach leaves

1 cup full-fat coconut milk

½ cup vegan yogurt

2 ounces roasted cashews, chopped

½ cup chopped fresh cilantro
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        Blend 1/4 of the onion, green chile pepper, 1/4 cup water, cashews, garlic, tomato paste, and ginger together in an electric blender, adding extra water if necessary, until paste is creamy and has the consistency of a pesto. Set aside.

Combine cloves, green and black cardamom pods, bay leaf, cumin seeds, peppercorns, coriander, and cinnamon in a mortar. Smash using a pestle to break open spices slightly, 3 to 4 times. Thinly slice remaining onion quarters.

Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add smashed spice mixture and toast until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in oil followed by cashew pesto, onion slices, cauliflower, broccoli, tomatoes, chickpeas, carrot, red chile pepper, garam masala, turmeric, and chili powder. Stir. Cancel the Saute function. Close and lock the lid.

Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 5 minutes. Allow 10 minutes for pressure to build.

Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir in spinach and mix to help wilt. Stir in coconut milk and yogurt. Mix and serve with roasted cashews and cilantro on top.
