    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spicy and flavorful vegan korma made in an Instant PotÂ®. There is a bit of preparation as with any korma, but cooking time is reduced, which helps free up time in the kitchen 
        as well as saving the integrity of the ingredients. The result is a dish with larger pieces of vegetables you can sink your teeth into. This is best served with naan bread or brown basmati rice.</p>
