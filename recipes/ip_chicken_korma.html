    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This instant pot chicken korma is rich, creamy, and flavorful. It’s the real deal y’all. This chicken korma is much tastier than what you’ll find in restaurants, and thanks to the instant pot, you can make it at home in like half an hour – definitely under an hour! The hardest part of this recipe is gathering all of the ingredients (which really takes only like 5 minutes). After that, it’s cake. Well, korma.

        This dish is also known as Shahi Chicken korma, and it’s a royal dish… literally. It’s from Mughlai cuisine, meaning that it was developed in imperial kitchens and served to royalty during the Mughal era in India (to kings, queens, jesters like me… just kidding).
        
        Mughlai dishes are a treat because they are so decadent. They’re creamy and rich and call for dried fruit and nuts, which add awesome texture. Pre-Instant Pot, I really only made korma when we were having guests over – it was a “special occasion” dish. While it’s still an excellent dish to make for guests, it’s also easy enough to make whenever I want a delicious and comforting meal.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        To make the onion tomato mixture, add the onion, garlic, ginger, Serrano pepper and tomato to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth. Set aside.
        Prepare the cashew sauce by adding the cashews and ½ cup water to a blender and blend until smooth. Set aside.
        Press the sauté button and add ghee, ¼ cup of cashews and golden raisins. Stir-fry until the cashews begin to turn golden. Remove the cashews and raisins and set aside to use as a garnish.
        Add cumin seeds and once they begin to brown, add the blended onion and tomato mixture. Stir-fry for 8-10 minutes, or until the onion and tomato mixture has thickened.
        Add the spices, stir, then add the chicken and mix well.
        Pour 1 cup of water into the pot.
        
        Secure the lid, close the pressure valve and cook for 10 minutes at high pressure.
        Open the valve to quick release any remaining pressure.
        Press the sauté button, add the blended cashew sauce and fenugreek leaves and cook for 2-3 minutes.
        Garnish with cilantro, ghee-coated cashews and raisins.
